Hello, i made discord bot with slash commands to work with FiveGuard Ban / Unban / Baninfo / Kick functions and i added fivem server status too

<b>If you'd like to buy custom bot you can dm me on discord: upik_</b>

# config.json:

- Bot Token (token from discord.com/developers/applications)
- FiveGuard resource
- Server Status (shows your current player count in the bot Activity)
- Discord Permissions (You need to configure which role will have access to the Command)
- Translation
- Fiveguard Permissions (if you want to use Discord Roles with Fiveguard Permissions)

# Configuration

1. Download Script and modules: https://www.mediafire.com/file/bk75ai840ywsq0l/node_modules.rar/file (put them in the bot script)
2. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and get your bot Token
3. Put your token in config.json
4. If you have yarn, replace it with this reworked yarn script: https://www.mediafire.com/file/w2t5k4n5nbs3vaf/yarn.rar/file
5. Add <b>ensure Fiveguard_Discordbot</b> to your server.cfg
6. Restart the Server.
7. Done!
