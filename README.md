Hello, i made discord bot with slash commands to work with FiveGuard Ban / Unban / Baninfo / Kick functions and i added fivem server status too

# config.json:

- FiveGuard resource 
- Server Status (shows your current player count in the bot Activity)
- Permissions (You need to configure which role will have access to the Command)

# Configuration
1. Download Script and modules: https://www.mediafire.com/file/bk75ai840ywsq0l/node_modules.rar/file (put them in the bot script)
2. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and get your bot Token
3. Put your token in config.json
4. If you have yarn, remove it from your server
5. Add <b>ensure Fiveguard_Discordbot</b> to your server.cfg
6. Restart the Server.
7. Done!
