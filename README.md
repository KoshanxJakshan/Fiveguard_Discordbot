Hello, i made discord bot with slash commands to work with FiveGuard Ban / Unban / Baninfo / Kick functions and i added fivem server status too

<b>If you'd like to buy custom bot (with commands that you want) you can dm me on discord: upik_</b>

# config.json:

- Bot Token (token from discord.com/developers/applications)
- FiveGuard resource
- Server Status (shows your current player count in the bot Activity)
- Discord Permissions (You need to configure which role will have access to the Command)
- Translation
- Fiveguard Permissions (if you want to use Discord Roles with Fiveguard Permissions)
- Revive Command (remember to change your revive trigger in Fivem/server.lua file)

# Configuration

1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and get your bot Token
2. Put your token in config.json
3. Add <b>ensure Fiveguard_Discordbot</b> to your server.cfg
4. Done!
